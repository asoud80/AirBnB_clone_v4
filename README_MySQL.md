0x02. AirBnB clone - MySQL
By Guillaume, CTO at Holberton School
Weight: 2
Project to be done in teams of 2 people (your team: Juan Duque, Andrea Castrillón Puerta, Angel Felipe Vargas Benitez
Project over - took place from 08-06-2021 to 08-12-2021 - you're done with 91% of tasks.
QA review fully automated.
Concepts
For this project, students are expected to look at these concepts:

Python packages
AirBnB clone
Background Context
Environment variables will be your best friend for this project!

HBNB_ENV: running environment. It can be “dev” or “test” for the moment (“production” soon!)
HBNB_MYSQL_USER: the username of your MySQL
HBNB_MYSQL_PWD: the password of your MySQL
HBNB_MYSQL_HOST: the hostname of your MySQL
HBNB_MYSQL_DB: the database name of your MySQL
HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE: the type of storage used. It can be “file” (using FileStorage) or db (using DBStorage)

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
What is *args and how to use it
What is **kwargs and how to use it
How to handle named arguments in a function

How to create a MySQL user and grant it privileges
What ORM means
How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table

Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
Python Unit Tests
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
You have to use the unittest module
All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
All your test files and folders should start by test_
Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge cases
SQL Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using MySQL 5.7 (version 5.7.8-rc)
Your files will be executed with SQLAlchemy version 1.2.x
All your files should end with a new line
All your SQL queries should have a comment just before (i.e. syntax above)
All your files should start by a comment describing the task
All SQL keywords should be in uppercase (SELECT, WHERE…)
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
The length of your files will be tested using wc
GitHub
There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a partner’s project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.

Comments for your SQL file:
$ cat my_script.sql
-- first 3 students in the Batch ID=3
-- because Batch 3 is the best!
SELECT id, name FROM students WHERE batch_id = 3 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;
$

Score: 100.00% (Checks completed: 100.00%)

In the industry, you will work on an existing codebase 90% of the time. Your first thoughts upon looking at it might include:

“Who did this code?”
“How it works?”
“Where are unittests?”
“Where is this?”
“Why did they do that like this?”
“I don’t understand anything.”
“… I will refactor everything…”
But the worst thing you could possibly do is to redo everything. Please don’t do that! Note: the existing codebase might be perfect, or it might have errors. Don’t always trust the existing codebase!

For this project you will fork this codebase:

update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v2
update the README.md with your information but don’t delete the initial authors
If you are the owner of this repository, please create a new repository named AirBnB_clone_v2 with the same content of AirBnB_clone

1. Bug free!
mandatory

Score: 34.72% (Checks completed: 44.44%)

Do you remember the unittest module?

This codebase contains many test cases. Some are missing, but the ones included cover the basic functionality of the program.

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ 

All your unittests must pass without any errors at anytime in this project, with each storage engine!. Same for PEP8!

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ HBNB_ENV=test HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ 

Some tests won’t be relevant for some type of storage, please skip them by using the skipIf feature of the Unittest module - 26.3.6. Skipping tests and expected failures. Of course, the number of tests must be higher than the current number of tests, so if you decide to skip a test, you should write a new test!

How to test with MySQL?
First, you create a specific database for it (next tasks). After, you have to remember what the purpose of an unittest?

“Assert a current state (objects/data/database), do an action, and validate this action changed (or not) the state of your objects/data/database”

For example, “you want to validate that the create State name="California" command in the console will add a new record in your table states in your database”, here steps for your unittest:

get the number of current records in the table states (my using a MySQLdb for example - but not SQLAlchemy (remember, you want to test if it works, so it’s better to isolate from the system))
execute the console command
get (again) the number of current records in the table states (same method, with MySQLdb)
if the difference is +1 => test passed

2. Console improvements
mandatory

Score: 65.00% (Checks completed: 100.00%)

Update the def do_create(self, arg): function of your command interpreter (console.py) to allow for object creation with given parameters:

Command syntax: create <Class name> <param 1> <param 2> <param 3>...
Param syntax: <key name>=<value>
Value syntax:
String: "<value>" => starts with a double quote
any double quote inside the value must be escaped with a backslash \
all underscores _ must be replace by spaces . Example: You want to set the string My little house to the attribute name, your command line must be name="My_little_house"
Float: <unit>.<decimal> => contains a dot .
Integer: <number> => default case
If any parameter doesn’t fit with these requirements or can’t be recognized correctly by your program, it must be skipped
Don’t forget to add tests for this new feature!

Also, this new feature will be tested here only with FileStorage engine.
